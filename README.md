# shared-dctl

A collection of my personal DCTLs that I’m making available to the community.  
Right now, these DCTLs are shared in **encrypted form**, meaning you can use them but not access the source code.  

I’m considering making parts of this library fully open-source in the future.  
If that happens, the repo will be updated with source code, documentation, and a clear licensing model.

## License
Currently **no license is granted** for modification or redistribution of the encrypted DCTLs.  
You are free to download and use them in your grading projects.  
An open-source license (likely MIT or Apache 2.0) may be added in the future if the source is released.
